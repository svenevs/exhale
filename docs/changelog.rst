   :local:
   :backlinks: none

v0.2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Allow unabridged API to exclude different kinds (:pr:`67`).
  :data:`~exhale.configs.unabridgedOrphanKinds` allows users to exclude a specific kind
  from getting dumped in the unabridged API beneath the hierarchies.

  By default, the unabridged API will exclude ``"file"`` and ``"dir"``, given that the
  file hierarchy already includes these.

v0.2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Make sure spaces in directory / filenames are quoted when sent to Doxygen (:pr:`60`).

v0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix bug where a ``union`` child of a ``namespace`` does not link correctly in the
  class hierarchy (:pr:`40`).
- Do not force pygments lexer to unconditionally use ``cpp`` for ``<programlisting>``
  pages.  Doxygen encodes a language, which is parsed and converted to the appropriate
  pygments lexer (:pr:`42`).

    - Added new configuration variable :data:`~exhale.configs.lexerMapping` for
      additional control over pygments language to use.
    - This marks the beginning of mixed-language support, but much more needs to be done
      for this!

- Most overloaded functions should now work.  See :pr:`45` for more information,
  including function overloads that do **not** currently work.

    - For consistency, the full api listing includes fully qualified function names
      (previously: ``Function foo``, now: ``Function namespace::foo(int)``).

- Stopped using deprecated sphinx API (:pr:`47`).
- Tree view hierarchies are minified by default (:pr:`48`).

    - Added new configuration variable :data:`~exhale.configs.minifyTreeView`.

- Parent directory links generated for ``directory`` and ``file`` pages (:pr:`49`).
- Tree view and namespace exclusion bypass configuration variable
  :data:`~exhale.configs.listingExclude` added (:pr:`50`).

    - Better logic for finding the file node that defined a given compound.
    - Doxygen produces inconsistencies with the paths, some are Windows paths and some
      are \*nix paths.  These should now all be corrected using ``os.path.normpath``.

v0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Exhale no longer produces filenames that are longer than the operating system can
  handle (:pr:`35`).

    - Internal links have changed, more heavily discouraged in docs.  Ideally the
      internal link generation scheme will not need to change again, but they might.
    - Exhale can handle absurdly long file paths by using the ``\\?\`` prefix on
      Windows.  If you run into a situation where this affects you, Sphinx actually
      cannot handle this.  So try and build in a higher directory, e.g.
      ``C:\your_project`` (paths greater than ``260`` characters cause this issue).

- First *mostly* functional release for Windows (there were many locations where
  ``os.path.normpath`` needed to be used.
- **Bug**: bug introduced where a ``union`` child of a ``namespace`` does not link
  correctly in the class hierarchy.

v0.1.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fix bug that prevents :ref:`usage_customizing_breathe_output` from working.  Was
  checking ``isinstance(val_t, six.string_types)``, but should have been checking
  ``isinstance(val, six.string_types)``.
- Fix / improve key guessing for when an invalid key is given in ``exhale_args``.

v0.1.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Colorized printing on Read The Docs is disabled, since their build logs online don't
  display the color.
- Doxygen ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` are directed to ``/dev/null`` on Read The Docs.  See
  :issue:`14`.

v0.1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- First release with manual namespace documentation parsing (same as files).

    - Limitations described in :ref:`file_and_namespace_level_documentation_in_exhale`.
    - Namespace documentation `example here <nspace_example>`_.

- Fixed bad error message when multiple potential file parents are found, which produced
  an exception preventing the rest of the build. Full description can be found in
  :pr:`12`.

v0.1.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Page level configuration metadata added to all pages (rather than just leaf-like
  pages).
- Fixed ``textwrap.dedent`` inconsistencies when more than one nested type is
  enumerated.
